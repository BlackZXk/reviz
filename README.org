* reviz - Visualize NFA and DFA constructed from basic regexp


This program takes a simple regular expression from commandline and generate
DOT files named nfa.dot and dfa.dot in current working directory, which are the
finite automatons constructed from that regular expression. These dot files can
be converted to various image formats by graphviz.

=reviz= is a simple wrapper which calls =redot= and converts generated dot
files to PostScript format, so the results can be displayed immediately with
various document viewer programs.


The "regular expression" this program accepts were only the most basic building
blocks. You can only use one or many of alternative operator =|=, Kleene star
=*=, positive closure =+= and optional mark =?= in your regular expression, and
the vocabulary is also restricted (you can only use alnums as input
characters). However I think that is just enough to show the underlying
principles of regexp pattern matching.
